# Lesson 2. Section Overview

- This section is about the comparison between SPA (Single Page Application) and erver Side Rendering.

SPA => the web is rendered on the client side and it uses a lot of havascript. It is "Single Page Application" coz it uses only one HTML file and it does not has to render everytime that a link is clicked!

# Lesson 3. CSR vs SSR

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12664271

CSR => Client Side Rendering. The page takes more time to load so developer place a spinnign so the user do not get annoyed
SSR => Server Side Rendering. Better experience for the user, no black page, but it also need extra time to make the page interactive

# Lesson 4. Server Side Rendering React

SSR in React can get quite complicated and messy. There are a ton of articles online that show you how to implement it and you can read those on your own. However, in this course we are going to be learning about Next.js which we will cover shortly. In my opinion it is the preferred way to create a server side rendered app because just like create-react-app, it allows us to focus on the things that matter instead of worrying about configurations that always change and aren't important to your development as a programmer.

Stay with me, and I promise it will get more clear how to do SSR properly!

CSR
props:

- Rich interaction
- Faster response
- Web applications

cons:

- low SEO potential
- Longer initial load

SSR
props:

- Static sites
- SEO: by the time it arrive to the client, it already has everything render. The content is presented before it actually get it in the view
- Initial page load

cons:

- Full page reload
- Slower page rendering
- Request to the server

# Lesson 6. SSR React Libraries

There are two main ways to do it:

- Gatsby.js
- Next.js: It is the easiest way

- Check <Static vs SSR vs CSR, Gatsby.js vs Next.js vs React> diagram

* We have to ask ourselve, where we want the heavy work to be done:

- React: Client side
- Next.js: Server side
- Gabsby: Developer computer

# Lesson 8. Setting Up Next.js
