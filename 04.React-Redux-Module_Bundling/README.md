- Friendly code, easy to pick up, hire many junios developers
- Like a microway, super simple, a lot less complicated than a oven

<Cons>

# Lesson 5. CWD: Introduction To React.js

# Lesson 6. CWD: Create React App

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/46096686

npx create-react-app [name of the app]

CLI:
npx create-react-app robofriends_init
cd robofriends_init
npm start

# Lesson 7. CWD: React App Folder Structure

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/35657685

<package-lock.json> secure that we can run this app anywhere in the world coz the packages abd depencies versions are lock

<.git> is a configuration file, automatically generated by react app

# Lesson 8. CWD: React 18 Update

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/42905842

- Libreries are constansly updating so my job is to be op top of my game, check de offitial docs.

In this example there is an update in React 18 so lower versions won't longer work. This is easy to solve if we know how to read the docs

# Lesson 9. CWD: React Fundamentals

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/35657684

- /public/index.html. This is th file where the whole app is served (bundle):

    <div id="root"></div>

- src/index.js. This is where all the file are bundle to be served in index.html:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
<React.StrictMode>
<App />
</React.StrictMode>
);

# Lesson 10. CWD: React Fundamentals 2

# Lesson 11. Hooks vs Classes

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/31923206

<Hooks> are a new feature and is specific for React while classes is common in for Javascript

- This course starts with classes and then convert into hooks which are super cool!

# Lesson 12. CWD: Class vs Functional App.js

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/35657686

- Before they use <class> and a <subclass> (extended) in App.js. Nowadays, Function is used. It simplier and cleaner

# Lesson 13. CWD: Your First React Component

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613134

- JXS => Part of React is to allow to write this HTML like
- This idea break the rule of separation of concerns, but React logic is that everything is contain in the components (CSS linked to .js file with the same name)

# Lesson 14. CWD: Building A React App 1

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613139

For the CSS is used: "tachyons": "^4.12.0",
It was not working after intalling coz I forgot to import it in index.js!

Here I had a bug. Stupid mistake:
I had this:
<Card id={robots.id[0]} name={robots.name[0]} email={robots.email[0]}/>
Instead of this
<Card id={robots[0].id} name={robots[0].name} email={robots[0].email}/>

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/46096765

It is very important to read the documentation! They have a UI section, they have a blog...

# Lesson 15. CWD: Building A React App 2

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613153

In this section explain the looping with high level function (map) and the importance of "key". key helps the DOM to identify if a element change without render the page again

# Lesson 15. CWD: Building A React App 3

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613166

<State> is an object that describe your application

- In this section a search form is used
- The search function is declared in the parent element (App.js) and pass it to the children (SearchBox.js)
- The component in charge to render the elements (CardList) recive the changed object by the search field
- With Redux this is simplier!

# Lesson 16. CWD: Styling Your React App

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613161

Gradient background:
https://cssgradient.io

Fonts:
https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/sega-logo-font

- I didn't use the example of the tutorial. Instead I use this website to create cool fonts:
  https://freefrontend.com/css-text-effects/#google_vignette

# Lesson 17. CWD: Building A React App 4

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613157

- Explanation about the life cycle hood in React.

- Using componentDidMount function to fetch
  this.state = {
  robots: [],
  searchfield: ""
  }

  componentDidMount(){
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
  .then(resp => resp.json())
  .then(users => this.setState({robots: users}));
  }

  - Use an if statement to show in the sreen while loading the data

* This is a old fasion to do this!

# Lesson 18. CWD: Building A React App 5

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613165

- This section is to explain to create a reuseable component (Scroll). How we can wrap CardList in this component so it make the website more appealing with the scroll

# Lesson 19. CWD: Building A React App 6

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613150

- Separation of concerns. Create a folder for the components and another one for containers (App.js)

// using ternary operators instead of if else
return !robots.length?

<h1>loading....</h1>
:
(
<div className="tc">
<RobotsTitle/>
<SearchBox searchChange={this.onSearchChange}/>
<Scroll>
<CardList robots={filteredrobot}/>
</Scroll>
</div>
);

# Lesson 20. CWD: Keeping Your Projects Up To Date

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613155

- To update:
  npm autofix

- To check what are the vulnerabilities:
  npm audit

- Update
  npm update

* I could just check what is the latest version and put it in package.json

# Lesson 21. Solution: Try Upgrading to React 18

# Lesson 23. CWD: Error Boundary In React

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/12613135

- This feature really shine in production.
- We create a component (ErrorBoundary.js). it is a classe extended to handle errors.
- We importe it in App.js and wrap the component that could throw errors, in this case CardList

# Lesson 24. CWD: Deploying Our React App

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap-2020/lectures/49022267

- This is another way to upload to GitHub. I won't use it!
