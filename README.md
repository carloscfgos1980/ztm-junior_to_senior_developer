# Chapter 05.Performance_Part_2

- Optimize the performance of the app: size of image, split coding (I was already using this, the Redux I don't need to clug App.js, the state is changed in the store and it is run in the business component)
- PWA = > Progressive Web App. This allows the app to work offline. I need to learn yet how to deploy as a native app in a phone thru App store!
- I learned how to use "lighthouse" chrome extension to improve perfomance
- how to deploy a static app in github
- React.Lazy() optimize the app by loading the page asynchronously, so it does not need to have all the elements to upload... still I not very convinced... it add boiler plate
