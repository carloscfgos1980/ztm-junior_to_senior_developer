# Chapter 04.OPTIONAL: React + Redux + Module Bundling

- Angular vs React vs Vue vs Svelte
- React classes
- React hooks
- React redux
- bundlers (webpack and parcel)

# Chapter 05.Performance_Part_2

- Optimize the performance of the app: size of image, split coding (I was already using this, the Redux I don't need to clug App.js, the state is changed in the store and it is run in the business component)
- PWA = > Progressive Web App. This allows the app to work offline. I need to learn yet how to deploy as a native app in a phone thru App store!
- I learned how to use "lighthouse" chrome extension to improve perfomance
- how to deploy a static app in github
- React.Lazy() optimize the app by loading the page asynchronously, so it does not need to have all the elements to upload... still I not very convinced... it add boiler plate

# Chapter 06.Testing

- Types of Tests:

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. Automation Testing

- Jest
- Jest. Unit test: Synchronous Tests
- Jest. Unit test: Asynchronous Tests
- Jest. Mock (this is painful to get it right!)
- Enzyme. It is a library to test React components. I skipped the whole topic

# Chapter 07.TypeScript

- Type is a pain in the ass! It should be used in simple apps, neverthless many company use this so it es very handy to master it. I will take a coule typescript tutorial before moving forward
- Topics:
- Dynamic vs Static Typing
- Weakly vs Strongly Typed
- Static typing in javascript (typescripte)
- TypeScript. Types of variables
- TypeScript. Interface, also type but not really in this course
- TypeScript. Assertion
- TypeScript. Assertion
- TypeScript. Functions and classes
- TypeScript. Union (variable with more than one type)
- Create React App with TypeScript

* Until here it was useful the course, I had to look in the docs in order to make the app work with typescript. It took nearly 10 hours!

I have created 3 apps so far:
my-app (just start up redux typescript app)
shoppingcart-nd-personList-app (tutorial redux typescript)
robofriends-app (upgrading robotsfriend app from redux to typescript redux including testing)
